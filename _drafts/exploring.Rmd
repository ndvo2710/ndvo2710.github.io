* Loading data into R
* Use **ls()** to list files. Data is named as `vehicle`

```{r}
load("~/Dropbox/Fall 2015/STAT 141/Assignment1/vehicles.rda")
ls()
vehicle = vposts
```

```{r}
library(lattice)
library(maps)
library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(DT)
```

```{r}
dim(vehicle)
names(vehicle)
unlist( sapply(X = vehicle, FUN = class) )
```


In this dataset, **price** is the most important variable to me. To get an in-depth look at the **price variable**, we should see the <u>distribution</u> of vehicle price. 

```{r, echo= FALSE}
