# Question

I am trying to create a new vector of prices from the given text. I am only allowed to use `gsub`.

~~~r
test = c('Testing $26,500\ntesting', 
         'Testing tesing $79+\n TOTAL: $79200', 
         'Testing $3880. Testing', 
         'Testing -$69000Engine: $69000100%',
         'Testing testing original price : $ 8 2 9 5 . Real price is $ 7 4 9 5')
~~~

<b>Desired Output:</b>

~~~r
> [1] 26500 79200  3880 69000  7495
~~~

I have tried multiple regular expressions but I can't get the correct results.

* First attempt:

~~~r
> gsub(".*\\$(\\d+)[,|.](\\d+).*", "\\1\\2", test)
[1] "26500"
[2] "Testing tesing $79+\n TOTAL: $79200"                                 
[3] "Testing $3880. Testing"                                              
[4] "Testing -$69000Engine: $69000100%"                                   
[5] "Testing testing original price : $ 8 2 9 5 . Real price is $ 7 4 9 5"
~~~

* Second attempt:

~~~r
> gsub(".*\\$(\\d+)[,|.].*", "\\1", test) 
[1] "26"                                                                  
[2] "Testing tesing $79+\n TOTAL: $79200"                                 
[3] "3880"                                                                
[4] "Testing -$69000Engine: $69000100%"                                   
[5] "Testing testing original price : $ 8 2 9 5 . Real price is $ 7 4 9 5"
~~~

* Third attempt:

~~~r
> gsub("(?:.*|.*?*)\\$([0-9]+).*", "\\1", test) 
[1] "26"                                                                  
[2] "79200"                                                               
[3] "3880"                                                                
[4] "69000100"                                                            
[5] "Testing testing original price : $ 8 2 9 5 . Real price is $ 7 4 9 5"
~~~
<u><b>Question:</b></u> How can I fix this and avoid using multiple gsub function calls?

# Answer

I don't believe there is a way to use only 1 call to gsub as you need to pre-process the last price where digits are "disconnected" with spaces, and the first one with a comma decimal separator.

I can only "contract" the code to 2 gsub calls:

* `gsub("([$]|(?!^)\\G)[\\s,]*(\\d)", "\\1\\2", test, perl=T)` will remove commas and spaces between the digits that follow $ symbol
*  `gsub("^(?|[\\s\\S]*-[$](\\d+)|[\\s\\S]*[$](\\d+))[\\s\\S]*$", "\\1", test, perl=T)` will actually get the required price number out of the strings.

~~~r
> test <- c("Testing $26,500\ntesting","Testing tesing $79+\n TOTAL: $79200","Testing $3880. > Testing", "Testing -$69000Engine: $69000100%","Testing testing original price : $ 8 2 9 5 . Real > price is $ 7 4 9 5")
> test <- gsub("([$]|(?!^)\\G)[\\s,]*(\\d)", "\\1\\2", test, perl=T)
> test <- gsub("^(?|[\\s\\S]*-[$](\\d+)|[\\s\\S]*[$](\\d+))[\\s\\S]*$", "\\1", test, perl=T)
> test
[1] "26500" "79200" "3880"  "69000" "7495"

Since you are learning regex, here are regex breakdowns:

<b>Regex 1:</b>

* `([$]|(?!^)\\G)` - match and capture a "leading boundary" construct matching a `$` symbol and the location after each successful match with `(?!^)\G` (`\G` also matches the beginning of a string, and we eliminate it with a negative look-ahead `(?!^)` )
* `[\\s,]*` - match 0 or more commas or whitespace
* `(\\d)` - match and capture a digit

With `\1\2` replacement pattern, we restore the `$` symbol and the digits after it inside the string.

<b>Regex 2:</b>
* `^` - Beginning of a string
* `(?|[\\s\\S]*-[$](\\d+)|[\\s\\S]*[$](\\d+))` <i>a branch-reset group</i> `(?|...|...)` where capturing group index is reset to 1 (so, we only need to use `\1` reference in the replacement pattern to address both `(\\d+)` from each alternative) matching....

    + `[\\s\\S]*-[$](\\d+)` - any zero or more characters (`[\s\S]*`) followed with a hyphen, then a `$`, and then 1 or more digits (`\d+`, Group1)
    + `|` - or...
    + `[\\s\\S]*[$](\\d+)` - any zero or more characters (`[\s\S]*`) followed with a `$` and then 1 or more digits (`\d+`, still Group 1)

And we replace all with just `\1` back-reference to get our results. - `[\\s\\S]*$` - any characters, 0 or more occurrences (`[\s\S]*`), up to the end of the string (`$`).
