    "So, Let's try some exercises to test your understanding about function:\n",

    "I think you will have no problem dealing with exercises related to constant or linear. So we will try to deal with Absolute Value and Quaratic\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Keep in mind:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Step 1: Find the linear group.\n",
    "Step 2: Find the vertex.(Linear group = 0)\n",
    "Step 3: Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### STEP 1: FIND LINEAR GROUP:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try some example of identifying the linear group of these functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Ex1:\n",
    "\n",
    "$g(x) = |x+2| - 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Linear group is x+2\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Ex2:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x) = 2 - \\frac{5}{2}|x-7|$\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Linear group is x-7\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Ex3:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x) = (x-5)^2 + 3$\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Linear group is x-5\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Ex4:\n",
    "\n",
    "$h(x) = 3(2x+3)^2 -2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Linear group is 2x+3\n",
    "\n",
    "#### STEP 2: FIND VERTEX:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "To find vertex:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Let (linear group) = 0\n",
    "=> Find x-value (This is vertex's x-value)\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Find y-value of vertex by plugging x-value into a function\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Ex1:\n",
    "\n",
    "$g(x) = |x+2| - 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "x + 2 = 0 => x = -2\n",
    "\n",
    "When x = -2 => g(-2) = -1\n",
    "\n",
    "So vertex is (-2,-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Ex2:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x) = 2 - \\frac{5}{2}|x-7|$\n",
    "\n",
    "x - 7 = 0  => x = 7\n",
    "\n",
    "When x = 7 => f(7) = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "So vertex is (7,2)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Ex3:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x) = (x-5)^2 + 3$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can do it in your head:\n",
    "\n",
    "So vertex is (5,3)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Ex4:\n",
    "\n",
    "$h(x) = 3(2x+3)^2 -2$\n",
    "\n",
    "So vertex is (-3/2, -2)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### STEP 3: TRANSFORMATION\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Ex1:\n",
    "\n",
    "$g(x) = |x+2| - 1$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Since the vertex that we find is (-2,-1), we can see that the vertext has already tells us how the graph will move:\n",
    "\n",
    "x = -2 means the original graph (orange color) will move to the left 2 unit\n",
    "y = -1 mneas the orginal graph (orange color) will move down 1 unit\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, the original graph move to the left 2 unit and move down 1 unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Do you see the vertex of the original graph which is (0,0) has moved to (-2,-1) ?)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Ex2:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x) = 2 - \\frac{5}{2}|x-7|$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can guess our vertex will move from (0,0) to (7,2)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "BE CAREFUL! We have the scale (5/2) in front of linear group. So do it slowly:\n",

    "###### First Transformation:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27868566/shots/shot_2016-09-13_02-50-03.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "###### Final Result:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can compare the final transformation to the original graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "The whole process could be explained as: The original graph flips upside down, scale with -5/2, then the graph moves along with the vertex from (0,0) to (7,2)\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27868566/shots/shot_2016-09-13_02-54-41.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Ex3:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x) = (x-5)^2 + 3$\n",
    "\n",
    "Same things are applied as the above two examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27868566/shots/shot_2016-09-13_03-01-50.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that: when we don't have the scale factor, the graph just move from the original vertex to the vertex that we find ( In this case, move from (0,0) to (5,3))\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Ex4:\n",
    "\n",
    "$h(x) = 3(2x+3)^2 -2$\n",
    "\n",
    "BE CAREFUL! DO YOU NOTICE THE SCALE FACTOR OF 2 INSIDE THE LINEAR GROUP AND THE SCALE OF 3 OUTSIDE THE LINEAR GROUP.\n",
